## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Control LED State and Brightness:**
  Easily toggle LEDs on/off and adjust brightness levels via the app interface.

- **Sensor Integration:**  
  - **DHT Sensor:** Monitor temperature and humidity data.  
  - **LDR Sensor:** Retrieve real-time light intensity readings.
  
- **Dynamic LED Configuration:**  
  Add or remove LEDs by modifying files in the `led_initialization` folder within the `repository` directory.  

- **Customizable MQTT Topics:**  
  Change the MQTT topics used by the application in the `topic_repository` file located in the `repository` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Structure**  
- **Repository Folder:**  
  - **`led_initialization`**: Contains configuration files for initializing LEDs. Modify these to add/remove LEDs.  
  - **`topic_repository`**: Houses MQTT topics. Update these files to adjust topics as per your MQTT setup.  

- **Sensors:**  
  Handles DHT and LDR sensor connections for seamless integration of environmental data.
